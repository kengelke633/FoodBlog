        <p>I have been a Food Blogger since I was 15 years old, my mother was a Food Blogger as well so I inherited her genes.</p>

      <h2> About Me! </h2>
        <img src="me.jpg" height='100%' width='35%'>
        <p>My family and I do Fast Food Fridays, where we take turns choosing restaurants to order food from.</p>
        <p>My friends and I often get Burger King, we have done this for years and we'd like to keep the tradition going.</p>
        <p>My favorite food I've gotten while on a vacation is escargot from the cruise ship going to the Bahamas. </p>
        <p>Eating while on vacation is hard for me because I have so many food allergies.</p>

        <p>These burgers are from numerous different restaurants.</p>

        <p>These burgers are good because they are all different and grilled using different grilling techniques.</p>
        <p>These burgers all smell and taste different because they all have different ingredients and different grilling techniques.</p>
